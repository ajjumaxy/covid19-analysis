## Analysis of social media conversations surrounding COVID-19 in Singapore

The following files were used to analyse Facebook, Reddit and Twitter data collected from January 2020 to March 2020. As more data is collected, the code serves as a template to conduct further analysis.
Analysis conducted include:
- Topic modelling to identify key topics and user groups in Singaporeâ€™s social media scene
- Sentiment analysis to model and evaluate netizen sentiments based on social media posts, against the growth of COVID-19 cases in Singapore
- Social network analysis to model the Twitter retweet network in Singapore on posts related to COVID-19
